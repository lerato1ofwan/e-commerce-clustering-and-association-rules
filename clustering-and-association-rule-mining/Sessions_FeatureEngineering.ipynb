        "  - They Aren't \"Extreme Users,\" They're \"Non-Users.\" A visitor with thousands of events is almost certainly a bot, scraper, or internal test account. This isn't just an \"enthusiastic shopper\"; it's a different category of user entirely. Our goal is to cluster real customer behavior, so these non-human actors must be removed.\n",
